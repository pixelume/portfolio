## Description
This SPA is a fully fledged Eye Chart application written for Eye Care Professionals. 
There is a bit of math involved to calculate the display sizes and spacing of the optotypes according 
to specified standards which depends on the resolution of, and the viewing distance from the display. 
The project was done using React, Redux, Styled Components &amp; React Router with Firebase authentication 
and real time database. It utilises quite a few CSS transitions &amp; animations. 
It includes an REST API integration with unsplash.com to pull featured images from their platform.

This is still a work in progress.
